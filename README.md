# RedBusDemandProject

Developed a machine learning model using Python, Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn to predict the final seat count for RedBus routes based on historical bookings and transaction data. Implemented robust data preprocessing steps including dataset merging, feature engineering (date-based features like month, day, weekday), and handling missing values.

Applied the Random Forest Regressor algorithm to forecast bus seat demand, optimizing for Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on validation data. Automated the prediction process for unseen data and generated a structured submission file for evaluation. The entire ML pipeline was executed on Google Colab, showcasing strong abilities in regression modeling, time series feature extraction, and real-world data analysis.
